<h4>Questions</h4>
<p>How can we correct for market risk in crypto?</p>
<p>Who has the highest risk-adjusted returns?</p>

<h4>Roadmap</h4>
<p>- The beginning of crypto</p>

<h4>The beginning of crypto</h4>

<p>Bitcoin emerged out of the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative monetary instrument, not controlled by any central authority or government. 
    The success of btc paved the way for others to experiment creating new cryptocurrencies. 
    But this diverted money away from btc and over time ate away at its market share. The race for returns was on.

<p>Note: coins selected are the top ten largest by market cap and also are the most viewed on CoinMarketCap (thus a proxy for popularity).</p>
<p>Returns and risk calculations in this project use data from the last 2 years, since Jan 2021. Firstly, most coins were just created several years ago. And secondly, because crypto only became popular 2 years ago (see below) and there is no point measuring returs few were there to achieve.</p>

<h4>Heart's Law</h4>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are highly correlated - in other words, they all move together. 
    A key reason for this is explained with Heart's Law: 
    price movements of interchangeable assets are connected through the liquidity of their trading pairs.<a href="https://0xcoast.com/2021/06/what-is-hearts-law/#:~:text=Heart%E2%80%99s%20Law%E2%80%A6%20that%20price%20movements%20of%20interchangeable%20assets,based%20on%20the%20liquidity%20of%20their%20Uniswap%20pairs.">[1]</a></p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Action! When creating a crypto portfolio, use the correlation matrix to diversify. Make sure the coins picked are not all heavily correlated.</p>

<h4>Standard deviation and Sharpe ratio</h4>

<p>Sd is a measure of volatility, and in financial markets its one measure of risk.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041415/what-are-some-common-measures-risk-used-risk-management.asp#:~:text=Certain%20statistical%20methods%20can%20help%20investors%20measure%20risk,of%20Risks%20...%207%20The%20Bottom%20Line%20">[2]</a>The more the asset deviates from its mean (higher Sd), the riskier it is. For clarity, here returns of 0.2 = 20%. The matic price therefore went up 6440% in the last two years.</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%" color= #040c82>
<h4>Sharpe ratio</h4>
<p>The Sharpe ratio is a measure of return that adjusts for the risk free rate and Sd. The higher the Sharpe, the better.</p>
<p>Sharpe = (return - risk free rate) / Sd</p>
<p>It's simply the green divided by the red - after subtracting the crypto risk free rate (<span>&#8776;</span> 1.7%)<a href="https://app.compound.finance/markets?market=1_USDC_0xc3d688B66703497DAA19211EEdff47f25384cdc3">[Compound]</a></p>
<div class="chart" id="Chart9"></div>
<br>
<br>
<hr size="2" width="100%" color= #040c82>


<h4>Crypto beta</h4>

<p>TradFi beta = (covariance between stock and S&P500) / variance of S&P500</p>
<p>Crypto beta = (covariance between coin and btc) / variance of btc </p>

<p>In the world of Traditional Finance, the beta of a stock measures its volatility relative to the overall market (S&P500). 
    A beta of 1 = perfect correlation with the market. A beta of 1.3 means the stock is 30% more volatile than the market. The higher the beta, the riskier it is.</p>
<p>You could argue btc is the S&P500 of crypto - lower returns, less volatility (Sd), less risk - the benchmark which you compare your returns to. The crypto beta therefore uses btc as the market.</p>

<hr size="2" width="100%" color= #040c82>


<h4>Treynor ratio</h4>
<p>Treynor = (return - risk free rate) / beta</p>
<p>The Treynor ratio is the return exceeding the risk free rate, adjusting for beta. The higher the Treynor the better, since returns are not simply correlation with the market.</p>
<br>
<div class="chart" id="Chart11"></div>

<br>
<br>
<hr size="2" width="100%" color= #040c82>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>Matic has the largest Sharpe and Treynor ratio: the highest returns after adjusting for standard deviation and correlation with the market. Doge is second place.</p>
<p>Doge, matic, shib have both the highest Sd's and beta's. Btc, dot, xrp are the least risky and yielded the lowest returns, before and after adjusting for risk.</p>
<br>
<hr size="2" width="100%" color= #040c82>
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>The two sources of data are CoinAPI and the yfinance library in python (colab pages linked). Yfinance is the main source for several reasons; its iterative and customisable nature eg. loops; ohlcv data; and because free keys on CoinAPI are limited to 100 requests a day.</p>
<p>Shib released in Aug 2020 and yfinance has data from Feb 2021 onwards. Whilst other returns and risk metrics are calculated over 2 years (for reasons explained in the first section), SHIB's time period is 20 months.</p>
<p>The risk free rate used is 1.7%, or 2.89% for the two year period. At the time of writing, this is the average DeFi lending rate (see Compound, Aave and Notional). They're not exactly risk free, but in crypto nothing ever is.</p>
